They come from two very different backgrounds - Marie is a poor fisherman's daughter, and Edward is the son of a wealthy aristocrat. Despite their class differences, they fall deeply in love and plan to elope. \\n\\nOn the night that they plan to leave, Edward and Marie meet on the beach at sunset for one final farewell. Marie is unaware that Edward has been disowned by his family and is penniless; his only hope is to marry a wealthy heiress. Marie overhears Edward making plans to meet with the heiress on the same night and is heartbroken. In her despair, she runs into the sea and drowns. \\n\\nEdward is devastated by Marie's death and is left with a heavy heart and a broken spirit. He soon discovers that the heiress he was to meet was a trap set by his family, who sought to ruin his happiness. In his grief, Edward joins Marie in death, throwing himself into the sea. \\n\\nTragedy at Sunset on the Beach is a heartbreaking tale of two lovers who were kept apart by the harsh realities\",\n",
